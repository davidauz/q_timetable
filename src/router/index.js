/*
the 'Router' is a JavaScript library for creating single-page applications with
multiple views, each with its own URL.
The Vue Router library provides a way to map URLs to components and manage the
navigation between those components.
It is thus possible to navigate between different views without a full page reload.
Instead, the router updates the URL and dynamically renders the appropriate
component in response to the user's actions.
